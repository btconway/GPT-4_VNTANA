\f0\fs22 \cf2 \CocoaLigature0 Here is some information on ModelOps. ModelOps is closely tied to our optimization engine. Here is a description of ModelOps in <ModelOps></ModelOps>:\
<ModelOps>\
The ModelOps Handler is an efficient tool that streamlines the process of optimizing and converting 3D assets. It functions as an umbrella for various scripts and provides an interface that makes it easy for users to select and perform tasks on these assets.\
Key Benefits:\
 \'95 The software houses numerous tools that simplify complex tasks such as file format conversions, optimizations for 3D assets, and generating image captures of 3D models.\
 \'95 It is equipped to support Object Storage Services, making it compatible with services like Amazon's S3 or Google's GCP Cloud Storage.\
 \'95 It can facilitate effective third-party communication.\
 \'95 All these services can be linked together to execute complex workflows, hence enhancing efficiency.\
 \'95 It provides a customizable system allowing users to perform a sequence of tasks on their assets, which can be defined according to their unique needs.\
 \'95 The tool's design ensures tasks always run sequentially, preventing any possible collisions or issues that may arise from parallel execution.\
 \'95 There's an option to add global callbacks at the pipeline level, enabling the tracking of task metrics and providing opportunities for additional third-party integrations.\
Here's an example of its use: Suppose you need to download a file from GCP Cloud Storage, optimize it, and then upload the result to AWS S3. This complex workflow can be simplified and automated using ModelOps Handler's task modules.\
The ModelOps Handler's key design principle is to ensure its utility to all users, regardless of the tasks' implementation. It provides all necessary tools to access its functions, making it a versatile addition to your 3D asset management toolkit.\
