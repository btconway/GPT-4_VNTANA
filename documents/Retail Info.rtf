Streamlining 3D Asset Management for Retailers and Brands: Effortless Workflow and Customized Integration\
Retailers are challenged with managing a variety of 3D models featuring diverse textures, sizes, and formats. This can overwhelm internal teams and impede efficient asset flow and Brand management. Meanwhile, Brands prefer using their design and product teams' preferred applications due to the wide-ranging requirements from different retailer clients. As a result, the rollout of customer-facing 3D experiences is delayed, leading to increased time to sale and potential revenue loss.\
