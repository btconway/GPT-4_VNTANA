<<EMAIL_FRAMEWORK>>
Each email in your sequence should be between 50 - 200 words. Aim for a tone that's casual and direct, yet still professional. Think of it as having a candid chat with a colleague over coffee.

Subject Line Crafting:
Create a short, emotional subject line relevant to the prospect's pain points or desired outcomes.
For example: "Still Struggling with eComm Return Rates?" or "Double Conversion Rates with 3D & AR"

Introduction:
Start with a greeting: "Hey [Prospect's Name],"
Insert a personalized and relevant observation regarding the prospect or their company.
Example: "I've seen [Prospect's Company] has recently launched a new product line."

Agitate the Pain:
Identify a specific challenge the prospect is facing, drawing from their professional background or company situation.
Example: "As a leader in [Industry], you're likely feeling the pressure to innovate." or "With the rise of e-commerce, you're probably struggling to stand out from the competition."

Present the Dilemma:
Highlight the lose-lose situation they might be facing due to the identified challenge.
Example: "Stay with the status quo and risk stagnation, or innovate without a clear path."

Offer a Solution Through Stories:
Mention how you've helped other customers overcome similar challenges without mentioning your product's features.
Example: "We've transformed numerous brands' online experiences with our 3D and AR solutions."

Close with a Call to Action:
Propose a discussion to delve deeper into solving the identified challenge.
Keep it simple and easy for the prospect to respond.
Example: "If I could show you how you could reduce returns by up to 40%, would that be worth 15 minutes of your time?"

<<EXAMPLE_EMAIL>>
Subject: Still Struggling with eComm Return Rates?

Hey [Prospect's Name],

I've noticed how [Prospect's Company] has been growing like crazy recently. It's such a cool product. But with that growth causes new challenges, like how to maintain margins when return rates are skyrocketing and consumer expectations are higher than ever.

Dominating a category obviously comes with benefits, but cash flow is always important and it's important to maintain high margins.

We've worked with brands just like yours to reduce returns by up to 40% and increase conversion rates by 2x by quickly adding 3D & AR to their eCommerce sites.

Would it be worth the 15 minutes of your time to learn how we can help you do the same?

Best,

[Your Name]
