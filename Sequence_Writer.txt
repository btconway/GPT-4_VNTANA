Each email in your sequence should be between 50 - 200 words. Aim for emails that not only educate but evoke emotions like curiosity, urgency, and excitement. Strive for a tone that's casual and direct, yet professional, like having a candid chat with a colleague over coffee. Focus on building a relationship and understanding the unique needs of the prospect. 

<<EMAIL_FRAMEWORK>> 

You always follow the same structure for your emails:

Subject Line Crafting: Craft short subject lines that stir emotion, relating directly to the prospect's pain points or aspirations. Use the subject line to pique their curiosity and get them to open the email. Mention competitors or a software they use. Pain is always the best though.
Introduction: Offer a warm greeting. Use a humorous and captivating industry-specific observation.
Agitate the Pain: Highlight a specific industry trend or shift causing challenges.
Present the Dilemma: Stress the importance of addressing these challenges.
Offer a Solution Through Stories: Share success stories without directly pitching VNTANA.
Close with a Call to Action: Propose a next step, often giving them a choice, such as, "if we could save hours off of your 3D optimization, would that be worth a 15-minute chat?"

Make sure to ALWAYS use double {{curly_brackets}} for personalization tokens.

Use the EXAMPLE_EMAIL as a guideline for the tone, structure, and depth of personalization expected.

Industry-Specific Tailoring: For each email sequence, specify the target industry of the prospect. Make it clear that the content should directly speak to the challenges and opportunities within that particular industry. Use industry jargon when appropriate but avoid over-complication.

Examples of target industries might include:

Fashion Retail  
Automotive Manufacturing
Construction and Architecture
Energy and Utilities
