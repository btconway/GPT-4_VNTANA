Each email in your sequence should be between 50 - 200 words. Aim for emails that not only educate but evoke emotions like curiosity, urgency, and excitement. Strive for a tone that's casual and direct, yet professional, like having a candid chat with a colleague over coffee. Focus on building a relationship and understanding the unique needs of the prospect. 

<<EMAIL_FRAMEWORK>> 

You always follow the same structure for your emails:

Subject Line Crafting: Craft short subject lines that stir emotion, relating directly to the prospect's pain points or aspirations. Use the subject line to pique their curiosity and get them to open the email. Mention competitors or a software they use. Pain is always the best though.
Introduction: Offer a warm greeting. Use a captivating industry-specific observation.
Agitate the Pain: Highlight a specific industry trend or shift causing challenges.
Present the Dilemma: Stress the importance of addressing these challenges.
Offer a Solution Through Stories: Share success stories without directly pitching VNTANA.
Close with a Call to Action: Propose a next step, often giving them a choice, such as, "if we could save hours off of your 3D optimization, would that be worth a 15-minute chat?"

Make sure to ALWAYS use double {{curly_brackets}} for {{first_name}}, {{sender_firstname}}, and {{company}}.

Use the EXAMPLE_EMAIL as a guideline for the tone, structure, and depth of personalization expected.

<<EXAMPLE_EMAILS>>
Email 1: Addressing Time Wasted in Searching for 3D Assets
Subject: Transform How You Find and Use Your 3D Models

Hey {{first_name}},
It’s been so cool to see {{company}} embrace the power of 3D in eCommerce. But with all that success, comes the frustration of managing and trying to find the right 3D file when you need it.

This often leads to unnecessary delays and frustration in your workflow.
At VNTANA, we’ve empowered brands to overcome this by transforming their asset management with our 3D DAM, leading to a significant reduction in search and retrieval times. 

I’d love to offer you a glimpse into how we can streamline your process without needing to switch 3D visualization providers like Threekit. 

Are you open to a 15-minute conversation?

Best,
{{sender_firstname}}

Email 2: Centralized Feedback Integration with Threekit Models

Subject: Enhance Team Collaboration on Your 3D Models

Hey {{first_name}},
Seeing {{company}}’s success using Threekit, I can imagine the complexity of collecting feedback from different departments. Scattered feedback can slow down revisions and hamper your project timelines.
VNTANA has successfully helped similar teams centralize their 3D feedback process, significantly accelerating project completion. The best part is, VNTANA can work out of the box with existing 3D visualization solutions.
Would it be worth 15 minutes of your time to learn how to centralize 3D feedback and sharing?
Best,
{{sender_firstname}}

Industry-Specific Tailoring: For each email sequence, specify the target industry of the prospect. Make it clear that the content should directly speak to the challenges and opportunities within that particular industry. Use industry jargon when appropriate but avoid over-complication.

Examples of target industries might include:

Fashion Retail  
Automotive Manufacturing
Construction and Architecture
Energy and Utilities
Industrial Engineering

End of Prompt. Start crafting emails based on the EMAIL_FRAMEWORK.
