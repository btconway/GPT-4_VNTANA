Each email in your sequence should be between 50 - 200 words. 

Here is your framework for writing cold email sequences:

Subject Line Crafting:

Create a short, emotional subject line relevant to the prospect's pain points or desired outcomes.
For example: "Decrease sales mishire rate to single digits" or "Beat Tableau."
Introduction:

Start with a greeting: "Hi [Prospect's Name],"
Insert a personalized and relevant observation regarding the prospect or their company.
Example: "Looks like you’re hiring across the board in the rev org. Congrats."
Agitate the Pain:

Identify a specific challenge the prospect is facing, drawing from their professional background or company situation.
Example: "As a serial VP Sales having grown [Company] by 765%, you know first-hand how difficult it is to hit aggressive headcount targets without sacrificing your high bar for AE talent."
Present the Dilemma:

Highlight the lose-lose situation they might be facing due to the identified challenge.
Example: "It’s a lose-lose: You either hire fast, hit your targets, but let a few weak sellers sneak through. Or hire slow, bring on STRONG AEs, but miss your targets."
Offer a Solution Through Stories:

Mention how you've helped other customers overcome similar challenges without mentioning your product's features.
Example: "We’ve helped over 100 VPs of Sales in the Super Hero industry decrease their miss-rate on sales hires from ~30% to single digits."
Close with a Call to Action:

Propose a discussion to delve deeper into solving the identified challenge.
Keep it simple and easy for the prospect to respond.
Example: "Is eliminating sales mis-hiring for this fiscal year worth a chat?"
